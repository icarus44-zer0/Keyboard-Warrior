# Keyboard Warrior
A Keyboard shortcut program for expanding user defined code snippets. 

### Installing

  System Requirements
  -------------------

  JDK:
    1.7 or above (this is to execute Maven - it still allows you to build against 1.3
    and prior JDK's).
  Memory:
    No minimum requirement.
  Disk:
    Approximately 10MB is required for the Maven installation itself. In addition to
    that, additional disk space will be used for your local Maven repository. The size
    of your local repository will vary depending on usage but expect at least 500MB.
  Operating System:
    Windows:
      Windows 2000 or above.
    Unix based systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X) and others:
      No minimum requirement.

  Installing Maven
  ----------------

  1) Unpack the archive where you would like to store the binaries, e.g.:

    Unix-based operating systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)
      tar zxvf apache-maven-3.x.y.tar.gz
    Windows
      unzip apache-maven-3.x.y.zip

  2) A directory called "apache-maven-3.x.y" will be created.

  3) Add the bin directory to your PATH, e.g.:

    Unix-based operating systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)
      export PATH=/usr/local/apache-maven-3.x.y/bin:$PATH
    Windows
      set PATH="c:\program files\apache-maven-3.x.y\bin";%PATH%

  4) Make sure JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your JDK

  5) Run "mvn --version" to verify that it is correctly installed.
